These are the operations this script can do:

  * clean: Delete all doc files.
  * make: Build the doc. Update only the changed files.
  * refresh: Full new build of the doc files (= clean + make).
  * transfer: Transfer the files to the server. Does not build them!
  * local: Open the local page in a browser.
  * remote: Open the remote page in a browser.

The operation can be provided via the command line parameter.
If none is given, make is executed.
