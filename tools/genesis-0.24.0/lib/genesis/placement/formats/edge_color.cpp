//     Placement Edge Color Functions

/**
 * @brief Returns a vector with a Color for each edge that visualizes the number of placements on
 * that edge.
 *
 * The vector is indexed using the edge.index(). Each edge gets assigned a Color value with these
 * properties:
 *
 *   * Edges with no placements on them are grey (RGB 0.5, 0.5, 0.5).
 *   * Edges with placements get a color according to the relative number of placements compared to
 *     the other edges. The edge with most placements is pure red (RGB 255, 0, 0), while lower
 *     numbers of placements smoothly transition towards yellow and green edges.
 *
 * The gradient can be controlled via the `linear` parameter. If set to `true`, the scaling of the
 * color gradient is linar in the number of placements. If set to `false` (default), it is
 * logarithmic. This way, the color resolution is higher for low placement numbers, and compressed
 * for higher numbers. A typical distribution of placements yields only some edges with a very high
 * number of placements, while most of the other edges have little to no placements. Thus, it is
 * reasonable to emphasize the differences between those edges with a lower placement count - which
 * is what the default does.
 *
 * See color heat_gradient() for more information.
