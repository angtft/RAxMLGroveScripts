 * See closest_leaf_distance_histogram() for general information about what this function does. The
 * difference between both functions is that this one first procresses all distances from
 * placements to their closest leaf nodes to find out what the shortest and longest are, then sets
 * the boundaries of the histogram accordingly. The number of bins is then used to divide this
 * range into intervals of equal size.
 *
 * The boundaries are returned by passing two doubles `min` and `max` to the function by reference.
 * The value of `max` will actually contain the result of std::nextafter() called on the longest
 * distance; this makes sure that the value itself will be placed in the interval.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     double min, max;
 *     int    bins = 25;
 *     std::vector<int> hist = closest_leaf_distance_histogram (min, max, bins);
