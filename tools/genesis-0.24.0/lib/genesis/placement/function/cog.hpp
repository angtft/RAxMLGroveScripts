/**
 * @brief Calculate the Center of Gravity of the placements on a tree.
 *
 * The center of gravity is the point on the tree where all masses of the placements on the one
 * side of it times their distance from the point are equal to this sum on the other side of the
 * point. In the following example, the hat `^` marks this point on a line with two placements:
 * One has mass 1 and distance 3 from the central point, and one as mass 3 and distance 1,
 * so that the product of their mass and distance to the point is the same:
 *
 *                   3
 *                   |
 *     1             |
 *     |_____________|
 *               ^
 *
 * It is thus like calculating masses and torques on a lever in order to find their physical
 * center of mass/gravity.
 *
 * This calculation is done for the whole tree, with the masses calculated from the
 * `like_weight_ratio` and distances in terms of the `branch_length` of the edges and the
 * `proximal_length` and (if specificed in the method parameter) the `pendant_length` of the
 * placements.
