/**
* @brief Calculate the expected distance between placement locations (EDPL)

 *
 * The EDPL is a measure of uncertainty of how far the PqueryPlacement%s of a Pquery are spread
 * across the branches of the PlacementTree. In a reference tree with similar sequences,
 * a query sequence might be placed on several nearby branches with relatively high likelihood (LWR).
 * This still constitutes a high confidence in the placement, as the spreading is due to the
 * similar reference sequences, and not due to inherent uncertainty in the placement itself.
 * This is opposed to a query sequence whose placements are spread all across the tree,
 * which might indicate that a fitting reference sequence is missing from the tree, and
 * hence yields uncertain placements.
 *
 * This can be assessed with the EDPL, which calculates the distances between different placements,
 * weighted by their respective LWRs:
 *
 * ![Example of the EDPL for a pquery with three placement locations.](placement/edpl.png)
 *
 * The `p` values in the figure represent likelihood weight ratios of the placements at these
 * locations. The distances `d` are calculated using the branch lengths of the tree on the path
 * between the placement locations.
 * Hence, a low EDPL indicates that the PqueryPlacement%s of a Pquery are focussed in a narrow
 * region of the tree, whereas a high EDPL indicates that the placements are spread across the tree.
 *
 * See http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_edpl.html for more information.
 * The function calculates the node distances of the tree first, which is needed for the computation.
 * See the other `edpl` functions for versions that take this matrix, in order to get speedups
 * when working with multiple Sample%s that use the same PlacementTree.

/**
 * @brief Calculate the variance of the placements on a tree.
 *
 * The variance is a measure of how far a set of items is spread out in its space
 * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/variance). In many cases, it can be measured using the mean of the
 * items. However, when considering placements on a tree, this does not truly measure how far they
 * are from each other. Thus, this algorithm applies a different method of calculating the variance
 * in terms of squared deviations of all items from each other:
 * \f$ Var(X) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2 \f$,
 * where \f$ (x_i - x_j) \f$ denotes the distance between two placements.
 *
 * According to the formula above, each pair of placements is evaluated twice, and subsequently
 * their distance need to be halfed when being added to the sum of distanaces. Instead of that,
 * we calculate the distance for each pair only once, thus are able skip half the calculations, and
 * of course skip the division by two.
 *
 * Furthermore, the normalizing factor \f$ \frac{1}{n^2} \f$ of the variance usually contains the
 * number of elements being processed. However, as the placements are weighted by their
 * `like_weight_ratio`, we instead calculate `n` as the sum of the `like_weight_ratio` of all
 * placements. In case that for each pquery the ratios of all its placements sum up to 1.0, this
 * number will be equal to the number of pqueries (and thus be equal to the usual case of using the
 * number of elements). However, as this is not required (placements with small ratio can be
 * dropped, so that their sum per pquery is less than 1.0), we cannout simply use the count.
