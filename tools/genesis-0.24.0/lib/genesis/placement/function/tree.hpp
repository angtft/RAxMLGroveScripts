/**
 * @brief Produce a @link tree::Tree Tree@endlink where the most probable PqueryPlacement of each
 * Pquery in a Sample is turned into an @link tree::TreeEdge Edge@endlink.
 *
 * The function takes the original @link PlacementTree Tree@endlink of the Sample, and for each
 * Pquery of the Sample, it attaches a new leaf @link tree::TreeNode Node@endlink to it.
 * The new leaf represents the most probable PqueryPlacement of the Pquery, measured using
 * the @link PqueryPlacement::like_weight_ratio like_weight_ratio@endlink. The leaf is positioned
 * according to the @link PqueryPlacement::proximal_length proximal_length@endlink and
 * @link PqueryPlacement::pendant_length pendant_length@endlink of the PqueryPlacement.
 * The resulting Tree is useful to get an overview of the distribution of placements. It is mainly
 * intended to view a few placements. For large Samples, it might be a bit cluttered.
 *
 * Similar trees are produced by
 * [RAxML EPA](http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/epa/index.html), where the file is called
 * `RAxML_labelledTree`, and by the [pplacer](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/)
 * [guppy](http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy.html)
 * [`tog` command](http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_tog.html#guppy-tog).
 * Both programs differ in the exact way the the placements are added as edges. To control this
 * behaviour, use the @p fully_resolve parameter.
 *
 * <b>Parameter `fully_resolve == false`</b>
 *
 * If @p fully_resolve is set to `false` (default), all placements at one edge are collected as
 * children of one central base edge:
 *
 * ![Multifurcating labelled tree.](placement/labelled_tree_multifurcating.png)
 *
 * This method is similar to the way RAxML produces a labelled tree.
 *
 * The base edge is positioned on the original edge at the average
 * @link PqueryPlacement::proximal_length proximal_length@endlink of the placements.
 * The base edge has a multifurcation if there are more than two placements on the edge.
 *
 * The @link PqueryPlacement::pendant_length pendant_length@endlink of the placements is used
 * to calculate the @link tree::CommonEdgeData::branch_length branch_length@endlink of the new
 * placement edges. This calculation subtracts the shortest `pendant_length` of the placements on
 * the edge, so that the base edge is maximally "moved" towards the placement edges. This also
 * implies that at least one of the placement edges has `branch_length == 0.0`.
 * Furthermore, the placements are sorted by their `pendant_length`.
 *
 * Using this method, the new nodes of the resulting tree are easier to distinguish and collapse,
 * as all placements are collected under the base edge. However, this comes at the cost of losing
 * the detailled information of the `proximal_length` of the placements. If you want to keep this
 * information, use `fully_resolve == true` instead.
 *
 * <b>Parameter `fully_resolve == true`</b>
 *
 * If @p fully_resolve is set to `true`, the placements are turned into single leaf nodes:
 *
 * ![Fully resolved labelled tree.](placement/labelled_tree_fully_resolved.png)
 *
 * This method is similar to the way guppy `tog` produces a labelled tree.
 *
 * The original edge is splitted into separate parts where each placement edge is attached.
 * The `branch_lengths` between those parts are calculated using the
 * @link PqueryPlacement::proximal_length proximal_length@endlink of the placements, while the
 * `branch_lengths` of the placement edges use their
 * @link PqueryPlacement::pendant_length pendant_length@endlink.
 *
 * Using this method gives maximum information, but results in a more crowded tree. The new
 * placement edges are "sorted" along the original edge by their `proximal_length`. For this reason
 * in the example image above, "Query 2" is closer to "Node A" then "Query 1": it has a
 * higher `proximal_length`. This information was lost in the multifurcating tree from above.
 *
 * <b>Further Details</b>
 *
 * For edges that contain only a single placement, both versions of @p fully_resolve behave the
 * same. In this case, the placement is simply attached using its `proximal_length` and
 * `pendant_length`.
 *
 * @link Pquery Pqueries@endlink with multiple PqueryName%s are treated as if each name is a
 * separate placement, i.e., for each of them, a new (identical) edge is added to the Tree.
 * If using `fully_resolve ==  true`, this results in a `branch_length` of 0.0 between the
 * nodes of those placements.
 *
 * @param sample        Input Sample to get the @link PlacementTree Tree@endlink and
 *                      PqueryPlacement%s from.
 * @param fully_resolve Control in which way multiple placements at one edge are turned into new
 *                      edges. See above for details.
 * @param name_prefix   Specify a prefix to be added to all new leaf @link tree::TreeNode Nodes@endlink
 *                      (the ones that represent Placements). This is useful if a PqueryName also
 *                      occurs as a @link tree::CommonNodeData::name name@endlink in the original
 *                      tree. By default, empty. In order to get the same naming as labelled trees
 *                      as produced by RAxML, use `QUERY___`.
 *
 * @return A @link tree::CommonTree CommonTree@endlink, i.e., a tree with node names and branch
 * lengths.
