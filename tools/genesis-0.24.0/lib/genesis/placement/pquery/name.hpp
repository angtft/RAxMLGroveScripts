 * This class is modeled after the `jplace` standard, which allows for multiple names for a Pquery.
 * This is useful if there are identical sequences in the original data for which the phylogenetic
 * placement was carried out. The placements of those sequences can then be treated as one entity,
 * i.e., one Pquery, while still maintaining all their identifiers (names).
 *
 * Furthermore, each such #name can have a #multiplicity, which can be used to store, e.g., the
 * number of replicates of the original sequence. It is used as a factor for the weights of
 * PqueryPlacement%s in some calculations.
