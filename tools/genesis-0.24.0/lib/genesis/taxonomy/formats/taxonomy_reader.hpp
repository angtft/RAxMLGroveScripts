/**
 * @brief Read Taxonomy file formats.
 *
 * This reader populates a Taxonomy.
 *
 * Exemplary usage:
 *
 *     std::string infile = "path/to/taxonomy.txt";
 *     Taxonomy tax;
 *
 *     TaxonomyReader()
 *         .rank_field_position( 2 )
 *         .expect_strict_order( true )
 *         .read( utils::from_file( infile ), tax );
 *
 * It expects one taxon per input line. This line can also contain other information, for example
 *
 *     Archaea;Crenarchaeota;Thermoprotei;Desulfurococcales;	14	order	119
 *
 * In order to separate the fields of the input, a @link utils::CsvReader CsvReader@endlink is used.
 * By default, all its properties except for the separator chars are left at their default values.
 * The separator char is set to a tab `\t` instead of a comma, as this is more common for
 * taxonomy files.
 *
 * Use the getter csv_reader() to access the CsvReader and change its behaviour, for example, to
 * change the field separator char. Also, all other properties of the CsvReader can be adjusted
 * in order to suit any char-separated input format.
 *
 * Once the fields of a line are split, this reader uses its properties
 * @link name_field_position( int value ) name_field_position()@endlink,
 * @link rank_field_position( int value ) rank_field_position()@endlink and
 * @link id_field_position( int value ) id_field_position()@endlink to determine which of the
 * fields represent the taxon name, its rank, and its ID, respectively. For example, given the line
 * from above, those would have to be set to `0` and `2`, and `1`, respectively. That is, the first
 * field of the line is the name of the Taxon, the third ("order") the rank, and the second ("14")
 * its ID. All other fields of the line are ignored, which in the example is the field "119".
 *
 * The taxon name is expected to be a taxonomic path string. This is what we call a string
 * consisting of the different parts of the taxonomic hierarchy, usually separated by semicola.
 * See Taxopath for a description of the expected format.
 *
 * This string is split into its @link Taxon Taxa@endlink using a TaxopathParser.
 * In order to change the behaviour of this splitting, access the parser via taxopath_parser().
 *
 * In summary, by default, this reader reads tab-separated lines and expects the taxonomy entry
 * to be the first (or only) field in the line and to be a taxonomic path in the format
 * described at Taxopath.
