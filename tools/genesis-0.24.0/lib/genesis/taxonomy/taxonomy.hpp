/**
 * @brief Store a Taxonomy, i.e., a nested hierarchy of @link Taxon Taxa@endlink.
 *
 * We call a string of the form
 *
 *     Animalia;Vertebrata;Mammalia;Carnivora
 *
 * a taxonomic path string. Those strings are often found in taxonomic
 * databases, and usually use semicola to separete their parts. Each part of such a string is
 * called a Taxon, and can have a rank associated with it. See Taxopath for details on the format.
 *
 * In the example above, the rank associations could be
 *
 *     Kingdom: Animalia
 *     Phylum:  Vertebrata
 *     Class:   Mammalia
 *     Order:   Carnivora
 *
 * We use the term "taxon" to refer to one element in such a string, and model this in the
 * Taxon class. Both the Taxonomy and Taxon classes work with just those parts of the string.
 * Each Taxon can itself contain further lower level Taxa, resulting in a hierarchy.
 *
 * The above taxonomic path string for example would give a hierarchy of Taxa like this
 *
 *     Animalia
 *         Vertebrata
 *             Mammalia
 *                 Carnivora
 *
 * where each line is one Taxon, stored within their parent Taxa. A Taxonomy is the uppermost
 * parent of the Taxa in the hierarchy.
 *
 * There are functions to work with taxonomic path strings and Taxopath%s directly,
 * for example to "translate" them into a Taxonomy or to find a Taxon given a Taxopath.
 * See the namespace taxonomy for a list of those functions.
 *
 * In a sense, each Taxon is itself a Taxonomy, because of their hierarchical relationship.
 * However, we use the distinction between the two in order to separate concerns.
 * That means, only the Taxonomy should be seen as the top level of the hierarchy.
 *
 * This class serves as a container for storing a list of @link Taxon Taxa@endlink. It allows to
 * @link add_child( std::string const&, bool ) add@endlink, @link remove_child() remove @endlink and
 * @link get_child() get @endlink Taxa by their name, as well as iterating over them.
