/**
 * @brief Reader for line-by-line assessment of (m)pileup files.
 *
 * This simple reader processes (m)pileup files line by line. That is, it does not take into
 * consideration which mapped read starts at which position, but instead gives a quick and simple
 * tally of the bases of all reads that cover a given position.
 * This makes it fast in cases where only per-position, but no per-read information is needed.
 *
 * For each processed line, a SimplePileupReader::Record is produced when using the `record`
 * versions of the read and parse function, which captures the basic
 * information of the line, as well as a tally for each sample in the line, collected in
 * SimplePileupReader::Sample. One such sample consists of two or more columns in the file.
 *
 * The number of columns per sample depends on the additional information contained in the file.
 * As we have no way of deciding this automatically, these columns have to be activated beforehand:
 *
 *   - Quality scores, set with_quality_string()
 *   - Ancestral alles, set with_ancestral_base()
 *
 * More columns might be needed in the future, and potentially their ordering might need to be
 * adapted. But for now, we only have these use cases.
 *
 * Alternatvely, using the `variant` versions of the read and parse functions, instead of producing
 * a SimplePileupReader::Record, a Variant per line in the mpileup file can be produced.
 * This tends to be slightly faster, and elimiates the need to do downstream conversion.
 * That is, instead of yielding per-line tallied bases and phred quality scores,
 * these functions directly yields their summed up counts of bases per line.

     * position on a chromosome, and consists of two or three entries/columns in the file:
     *
     *  1. A read count.
     *  2. A list of bases (and some other information on read start and end etc) from the reads
     *     that cover the given position on the chromosome.
     *  3. (Optionally) A list of phread-scaled ASCII-encoded quality scores for the list of bases.
     *  4. (Optionally) The ancestral base at the position (some pileup files have this).
     *
     * As this here is a simple reader, we ignore the information on read starts/ends, as well as
     * potential insertions and deletions (indels), and instead simply tally up the number of
     * actual bases of the reads that cover a position. This Sample struct here collects this
