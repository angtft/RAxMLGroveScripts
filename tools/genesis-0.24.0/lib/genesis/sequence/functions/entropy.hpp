     * @brief In addition to the characters of the SiteCounts object, use the undetermined and

     *
     * With this option, an additional term is added to the entropy, using the "rest" probability
     * of the site. The counts of all characters at a site in the SiteCounts do not always add
     * up to the number of sequences that have been added. In cases where a Sequence contains gaps
     * or characters that are not set in the SiteCounts object, those counts are simply ignored
     * when processing the Sequence and counting its sites.
     *
     * Using this ignored rest, an additional entropy term is calculated and added to the total
     * entropy, if this option is used.
     *
     * For example, if the SiteCounts object counts all occurences of `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`,
     * and a Sequence added to it contains a gap `-` or a degenerated character like `W`, those
     * character are ignored in the counts. The total number of those characters is then:

     *                    - counts.count_of( 'T', site_idx );
     *
     * This number is then used as an additional summand for the entropy:
     * \f$ H_{i} \f$ `+=` \f$ -f_{{-,i}}\times \log _{2}f_{{-,i}} \f$, with
     * \f$ f_{-,i} = \f$ `gap_count/counts.added_sequences_count()` being the relative frequency
     * of those gaps and undetermined characters.

     * gaps and other undetermined characters (those which are not used in the SiteCounts object)
     * are igonred. Thus, the entropy for sites that contain mostly gaps might still have quite a
     * high value. In cases where mostly-gap sites shall add little to the total entropy, this
     * option can be used to reduce their influence. The site_entropy() is then weighted using the
     * sum of the frequencies of the determined sites.
     *
     * For example, if a site has fractions of 0.1 for all four characters `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`,
     * the resulting entropy is weighted with a factor of 0.4.
