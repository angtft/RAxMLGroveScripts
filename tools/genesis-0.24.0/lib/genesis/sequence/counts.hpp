/**
 * @brief Store counts of the occurence for certain characters at the sites of Sequence%s.
 *
 * This class is a helper for statistical analyses of Sequences, and for calculating consensus
 * sequences and the like. It stores a @link utils::Matrix Matrix@endlink of counts, for a
 * set of characters and a given sequence length. That is, it expected aligned (same length)
 * sequences.
 *
 * For example, we create an instance like this:
 *
 *     auto sequence_counts = SiteCounts( "ACGT-", 6 );
 *
 * which counts the occurences of the nucleodite characters and the gap character for Sequence%s
 * of length 6. Then, after adding several Sequences, the matrix might look like this (site
 * indices in columns, characters in rows):
 *
 * site |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
 * ---- | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -:
 * A    |  3 |  0 |  1 |  3 |  0 |  0
 * C    |  1 |  2 |  1 |  1 |  4 |  1
 * G    |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  1
 * T    |  2 |  1 |  3 |  3 |  1 |  3
 * -    |  2 |  4 |  2 |  1 |  2 |  2
 *
 * The class has to be constructed with the desired set of characters and sequences length.
 * Characters are automatically used in both upper and lower case for counting.
 * All not-included characters are simply ignored when adding Sequences.
 *
 * Use add_sequence() and add_sequences() to accumulate counts. Use count_of() and count_at() to
 * get the counter values for specific positions in the matrix.
