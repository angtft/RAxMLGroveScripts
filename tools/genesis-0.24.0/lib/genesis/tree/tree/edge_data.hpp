/**
 * @brief Base class for storing data on @link TreeEdge Edges@endlink of a Tree.
 *
 * This class provides the start point for the class hierarchy of edge data classes. In order to
 * correctly achieve polymorphic behaviour, and with its use case in a Tree in mind, this class and
 * its derived classes are supposed to be used via unique pointers to their instances. Although
 * this yields automatic memory management, it unfortunately disallows covariant return types.
 *
 * The class thus provides a static create() function instead of a default constructor. This needs
 * to be reimplemented in derived classes in order to allow creation of objects of the exact derived
 * type. For similar reasons, instead of a copy constructor, it provides a clone() function.
 *
 * Furthermore, the class provides a virtual recreate() function that default-constructs an object
 * of the same derived type as it was called on. This is allows to create new data instances for a
 * Tree without the need to know the exact derived type. For example, this can be used when adding
 * new Edges to a Tree, in order to fill them with default-constructed data of the same type of
 * some other Edges of the Tree.
 *
 * It is recommended that derived classes follow the same access rules for its constructors.
 * See CommonEdgeData for an example.
 *
 * This class does not contain any data itself. See BaseNodeData for its "partner" class.
