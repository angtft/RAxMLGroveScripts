/**
 * @brief Base class for creating plugin classes that allow coloring of Tree edges.
 *
 * The effect of this class on the Tree output is that (if enabled) a color tag will be added to
 * each edge.
 *
 * There are two ways this plugin can be used:
 *
 *   1. Use `edge_color_vector()` to set a vector of colors for each edge before calling the
 *      actual writing function. This can be done by client code that needs a particular coloring
 *      of the edges, but can also be used by superclasses to set all edge colors at once.
 *   2. Use `set_color()` in the superclass to set the color of individual edges. This is helpful
 *      within the `edge_to_element()` function of the superclass. This function is however not
 *      implemented in this base class, as it needs knowledge of the actual type of Tree output to
 *      work. Thus, this is a function that the plugin classes should provide.
 *
 * If neither of this is done, no color tags will be written. Color tags can also be deactivated
 * by client code using the `enable_color()` option.
 *
 * Furthermore, with the ignored_color option, by default, all edged that are colored black
 * (`Color(0, 0, 0)`) are ignored in the output, i.e., they produce no color tag. See ignored_color
 * to set the value to a different color.
 *
 * For the root node, there is no color tag written, for those reasons:
 *
 *   * In unrooted trees, the color tags for the nodes next to the root will cover all edges
 *     anyway. In other words, there is no "root edge" that could get a color.
 *   * In rooted trees, the root node has two edges. Those two combined edges are usually
 *     interpreted as the one edge where the root is located. So again, there are actual edges
 *     that can be colored - no need for an extra root color.
 *     Caveat: It is possible to give different colors to those edges. What that means is up to
 *     the user.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used as base for plugin classes that do actual tree output.
