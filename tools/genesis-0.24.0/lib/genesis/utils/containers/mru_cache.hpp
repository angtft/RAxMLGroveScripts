/**
 * @brief Most Recently Used Cache.
 *
 * The class offers a cache that maps from unique keys of type `Key` to values of type `T`,
 * automatically loading elements as needed using the
 * @link MruCache::load_function load_function@endlink.
 * The cache only keeps a certain number of elements. That is, the elements that
 * were least recently used are removed to avoid exceeding the capacity().
 *
 * The main functions are fetch() and fetch_copy(), which retrieve an element from the cache,
 * potentially loading it first, and potentially removing old elements.
 * During a fetch, it is possible that one more element is kept in memory than the capacity allows,
 * before removing the oldest one. This is done in order to recover from a load that failed
 * (with an exception) without altering the state of the cache.
 *
 * In order to use this class, the functor @link MruCache::load_function load_function@endlink
 * has to be set before calling fetch(), fetch_copy() or touch(). The functor needs to take a const
 * reference to the key type `Key` and return a mapped type `T` by value.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ~~~cpp
 * // Path to some data.
 * std::string dir = "/path/to/data";
 *
 * // Create a cache from file names to file contents, with a capacity of 5.
 * MruCache<std::string, std::string> cache{ 5 };
 *
 * // Our load function is to read the file.
 * cache.load_function = [ &dir ]( std::string const& file ){
 *     return file_read( dir + "/" + file );
 * };
 *
 * // Access an element, that is, load a file into the cache.
 * auto const& content = cache.fetch( "test.txt" );
 * ~~~
 *
 * Caching large files in a multi-threaded environment is a main use case of this class. In order
 * to avoid fetching actual copies of the data each time, `std::shared_ptr` can be used.
 * See fetch_copy() for details.
 *
 * Lastly, a second functor @link MruCache::release_function release_function@endlink can be used
 * to specify a function that is exectued before an element is removed from the cache.
 * If this functor is not set, the element is simply removed without any prior call.
 *
 * Thread safety: As fetch() returns by reference, it is not thread safe. A fetched element can be
 * removed at any time when other threads invoke fetch() again, leaving to a dangling reference.
 * Thus, for multi-threaded use, fetch_copy() can be used, which is guarded and returns a copy of
 * the elment instead. See there for details.

     * This is the main function of the class. It gets an element given its @p key, either by
     * retrieving it from the cache, or loading it into the cache first, if needed.
     *
     * If loading an element leads to the capacity of the cache begin exceeded,

     * to the cache being altered.
     *
     * Thread safety: Not thread safe, because it does not use a guard, and because it returns a
     * reference, which can become dangling if other threads fetch new elements, leading to the

     * over keys, fetching an element in the beginning of the loop body and keeping the reference
     * only within the loop body without calling fetch() again, is fine.

     *
     * Because the loading is not part of the mutex that makes this function thread safe,
     * it is possible to parallely load elements in different threads.
     * However, when two threads need to load an element at the same time, the loading
     * may happen twice. Then, only the first thread that finishes loading stores the element
     * in the cache, while the other one is discarded. This is done in order to allow
     * parallel loading without the hassle of per-element locks.
     *
     * If the cache is used in a multi-threaded environment and holds large elements,
     * making actual copies might be too expensive. In that case, a neat trick is to store
     * shared pointers to the elements instead:

     * // Store it by copy, which just copies the shared pointer.
     * auto content = cache.fetch_copy( "large_file.txt" );
     * ~~~
     *
     * As the control block of `std::shared_ptr` is thread safe, these shared pointer copies can
     * stay alive in a thread that still needs the element, even if the element was removed from
     * the cache by other threads in the meantime.
