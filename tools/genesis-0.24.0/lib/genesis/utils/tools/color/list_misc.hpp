 * @brief Color palette from the the Nextstrain build for novel coronavirus (nCoV) at
 * https://nextstrain.org/ncov
 *
 * The palette starts at purple and blue, progresses via green and yellow, towards orange and red.
 * This function returns a palette with 256 entries.
 * The original palette also has a reduced set of colors when using < 16 entries. We made these available
 * via the @link color_list_nextstrain( size_t n ) color_list_nextstrain( size_t n )@endlink
 * function, see there for details.
 *
 * This color palette is adapted from the Nextstrain build for novel coronavirus (nCoV) at
 * https://nextstrain.org/ncov, using their color scheme
 * https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/config/color_schemes.tsv
 * and converting parts of it to RGB `double` values.
 * The repository at https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov is published under the

/**

 * https://nextstrain.org/ncov
 *
 * The original palette has a reduced set of colors when using < 16 entries. This function makes
 * these reduced color sets available when using `n < 16`. All values above that use the full
 * palette (with 256) and interpolate to the requested number of entries. NB: The original palette
 * continues to 500 colors as well, but the differences between adjacent entries are diminishing,
 * so that our approach of interpolation when requesting a palette with more than 256 entries
 * yields highly similar entries. Also, who needs a palette with that many entries anyway?!
