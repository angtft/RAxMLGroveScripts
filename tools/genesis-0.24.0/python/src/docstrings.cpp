This is done to make sure that an exception thrown when loading the new element does not lead to the cache being altered.Thread safety: Not thread safe, because it does not use a guard, and because it returns a reference, which can become dangling if other threads fetch new elements, leading to the referenced one being removed. For multi-threaded use, see fetch_copy().Caveat: Even in single-thread use, a variable storing a reference obtained from fetch() can become dangling, if more new elements are fetched or touched than the capacity allows. Thus, the variable needs to go out of scope before this happens. For example, a loop over keys, fetching an element in the beginning of the loop body and keeping the reference only within the loop body without calling fetch() again, is fine."},

See fetch() for details.Because the loading is not part of the mutex that makes this function thread safe, it is possible to parallely load elements in different threads. However, when two threads need to load an element at the same time, the loading may happen twice. Then, only the first thread that finishes loading stores the element in the cache, while the other one is discarded. This is done in order to allow parallel loading without the hassle of per-element locks.If the cache is used in a multi-threaded environment and holds large elements, making actual copies might be too expensive.

See [Earth mover's distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover's_distance) for an introduction.In our case, we use distibutions of masses along the branches of a tree. Each branch can have multiple masses at different positions within [0.0, branch_length].The distance is calculated as the amount of work needed to move the masses of one distribution so that they end up in the positions of the masses of the other distribution. Work is here defined as mass times dislocation. Thus, the work is higher if either more mass has to be moved, or if mass has to be moved further.Here, the parameter p is used to control the influence of mass and distance, with 0.0 < p < inf, and default p == 1.0, which is the neutral case. A larger p increases the impact of distance traveled, while a smaller p emphasizes differences of mass. For details, see the references cited below.The resulting distance is independed of the rooting of the tree and commutative with respect to the two mass distributions.The earth mover's distance is only meaningful if both mass distributions contain the same amount of total mass. See mass_tree_sum_of_masses()  to check this. Also, in order to give comparable results over different tree topologies, the mass can be normalized using mass_tree_normalize_masses(). Then, the result of the earth mover's distance is always in the range [ 0.0, 1.0 ].See earth_movers_distance( Sample const&, ... )  for an exemplary usage of this function, which applies the earth mover's distance to the placement weights (like_weight_ratio) of a PlacementTree.References:[1] Guppy Documentation: http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_kr.html#guppy-kr[2] F.

See there for more details.It uses the following convention for the two distributions: The masses of one distribution are stored using a positive sign, the masses of the other distribution use a negative sign. This way, only one Tree needs to be stored, and the algorithm is significantly simplyfied.Thus, as the earth mover's distance is only meaningful if both distributions have the same sum, and we use opposite signs to store the masses, the sum of all masses on the tree should ideally be zero (apart from numerical derivations). See mass_tree_sum_of_masses()  and mass_tree_validate()  for functions to verify this.The function returns two doubles: The first one is the actual distance, the second one gives the remaining mass at the root node. This should also be close to 0.0, as there, all masses from the subtrees should ideally cancel each other out. Use this value to check whether this actually worked out. Too big numbers indicate that something is wrong with the sums of the signed masses."},

The number of border taxa (or \"leaves\") of the included Taxa then is aimed to be as close as possible to the target size.That means, this function sets the status of the Taxa, but does not remove any Taxa.

In the latter case, Tax_7 is inside, Tax_1, Tax_8 and Tax_9 are border, and again all others are outside.It is not always possible to prune a Taxonomy in a way the we exaclty hit the target size. The function then ends at a number of border Taxa that is closest (either below or above the target size).In order to decide which Taxa to set to inside (i.e., not include as leaves, but further resolve into their children), we use the entropies of the Taxa: We choose to split up at a current border Taxon with the highest entropy value, as long as this brings us closer to the target size.This means that the above case where we had two possible ways of splitting should be rare, as the entropies will rarely be identical with real world data sets.

It uses similarity_factor to decide which counts are close enough to each other in order to be considered ambiguous.For example, with similarity_factor == 1.0, only exact matches are used, that is, if two counts are exactly the same. Let count('A') == 42 and count('T') == 42, and both other counts (C and G) be 0, this results in the code W at that site. If however count('T') == 41, only A is used for the site. Thus, with similarity_factor == 1.0, this function behaves very similar to consensus_sequence_with_majorities(), except in cases were two counts are exaclty the same.On the other hand, with similarity_factor == 0.0, all codes that are present at a site are considered to be ambiguous. That is, if a site contains counts > 0 for A, G and T, the resulting site gets the code D (\"not C\").For intermediate values, e.g., the default 0.9, the value is used as a threshold to decide the ambiguities. For example, let count('A') == 42 and count('T') == 38, and both other counts be 0. Then, the allowed deviation from the maximum 42 is 0.9 * 42 = 37.8. Thus, as the count for T is above this value, those two codes are considered ambiguous, resulting in a W at that site.The optional parameter allow_gaps (default is true) behaves similar to its counterpart in consensus_sequence_with_majorities(). If set to true, the count of the gap character is also considered. As the ambiguity for a gap combined with any other character is still a gap, sites where gap is the most frequent charater or is within the deviation get a gap as result.If allow_gaps is set to false instead, gaps are not considered. That means, the ambiguities are calculated as if there were no gaps. So even if a site contains mostly gaps, but only a few other characters, those will be used. Solely all-gap sites result in a gap at that site.Remark: As this function expects nucleic acid codes, the gap character is fixed to '-' here. The ambiguity codes are converted using nucleic_acid_ambiguity_code().

Thus, it works for all kinds of sequence codes, e.g., nucleic acid or amino acid codes.The optional parameter allow_gaps (default is true) determines whether gaps in the consensus sequence are allowed. By default, if a site consists mostly of gaps, the consensus sequence also contains a gap at that site. If however this option is set to false, the consensus sequence will contain the most frequent non-gap character, even if there are more gaps at this site than the character itself. In other words, if the parameter is set to false, gaps are treated as missing characters instead of another type of character for computing the consensus. The only exception are gaps-only sites; in this case, the resulting sites contain a gap characters even if the parameter is set to false.The optional parameter gap_char (default value '-') is used for sites where no counts are available (i.e., are all zero), or, if allow_gaps is set to true, for sites that contain mostly gaps.Furthermore, if two or more characters have the same frequency, the first one is used.

    {"std::string ::genesis::sequence::consensus_sequence_with_threshold (SiteCounts const & counts, double frequency_threshold=0.6, bool allow_gaps=true, bool use_ambiguities=true)", "Calculate a consensus sequence where the character frequency needs to be above a given threshold, for nucleic acid codes ACGT.\n\nThe function calculates a consensus sequence for nucleic acid codes (ACGT). It uses the frequency of characters at each site to determine the consensus. The frequency is relative to the total number of counts at that site, thus, it is a value in the range [ 0.0, 1.0 ].If the frequency of a character at a site is above the given frequency_threshold, it is used for the consensus. If not, the resulting character depends on use_ambiguities. If use_ambiguities is set to true (default), the sorted frequencies of the characters are added until the threshold is reached, and the ambiguity code for those characters is used. For example, let frequency_threshold == 0.9, count('A') == 42 and count('T') == 42, and both other counts (C and G) be 0. Then, neither A nor T have counts above the threshold, but combined they do, so the result is code W == AT at that site. If however use_ambiguities is false, the mask character X is used for sites that are below the threshold.Furthermore, if allow_gaps is set to true (default), gaps are counted when determining the threshold and checking whether the frequency is above it. That is, gaps are then treated as just another character at the site. For sites where the gap frequency is needed to reach the threshold, a gap is used as consensus. If allow_gaps is false, however, gaps are not counted for determining the frequency of the other characters. This is similar to the counterpart in consensus_sequence_with_majorities(). Solely sites that are gaps-only result in a gap char for the consensus then.For frequency_threshold < 0.5, it may happen that more than one character has a frequency above the threshold. In such cases, the most frequent character is used (or, if they have exaclty the same counts, they are used in the order ACGT). This is in line with the behaviour of consensus_sequence_with_majorities(). Usually, however, the threshold is above 0.5 anyway, as this gives more meaningful results. If you want to use ambiguity characters for low frequency characters, you can use consensus_sequence_with_ambiguities() instead.An extreme case is a frequency_threshold of 1.0. In this case, for sites which only have one character, this one is directly used in the consensus. Sites with multiple different characters result in the ambiguity code of all occuring characters at that site. Thus, the function then behaves similar to consensus_sequence_with_ambiguities() with a similarity_factor of 0.0.The other extrem case is a frequency_threshold of 0.0. In this case, the function simply uses the most frequent character per site, as it always fulfills the threshold. As said above, if then more than one character has exactly the same frequency, they are used in the order ACGT, thus the function then behaves similar to consensus_sequence_with_majorities().Remark: As this function expects nucleic acid codes, the gap character is fixed to '-' here, and the mask character to 'X'. The ambiguity codes are converted using nucleic_acid_ambiguity_code().

It is mainly a helper method for distance calculations (e.g., pairwise distance, variance).\n\nFor each placement in the two pqueries, a distance is calculated, and their weighted sum is returned. Weighing is done using the mass of placements in both pqueries.The distance between two placements is calculated as the shortest path between them. This includes the their position on the branches, and - if specified - the pendant_length of both. There are three cases that might occur:\nBoth placements are on the same branch. In this case, their distance is caluclated as their difference in proximal_lengths (plus the sum of their pendant_lengths, if specified).The path between the placements includes the root. The distance of a placement from its neighbouring nodes is usually given in form of the proximal_length, which is the distance of the placement to the node (at the end of its branch) that lies in direction of the root. Thus, there is an implicit notion of a root, that we need to consider. If the path between two placements contains the root, we can directly calculate their distance as the distance between the two promixal nodes plus proximal_lengths (and possibly pendant_lengths) of both placements. We call this the promixal-promixal case.The root is not part of the path between the placements. This case means that one of the two placements lies on the path between the other placement and the root  thus, the path between the placements does not contain the root. The distance between the placements cannot be calculated using the proximal_lengths directly, but we need to get the distal_length (away from the root) of the inner placement first. This is simply the difference between branch_length and proximal_length of that placement. Of course, this case comes in two flavours, because both placements can be the inner or outer one. They are called proximal-distal case and distal-proximal case, respectively.\nThe first case is easy to detect by comparing the edge nums. However, distinguishing between the latter two cases is expensive, as it involves finding the path to the root for both placements. To speed this up, we instead use a distance matrix that is calculated in the beginning of any algorithm using this method and contains the pairwise distances between all nodes of the tree. Using this, we do not need to find paths between placements, but simply go to the nodes at the end of the branches of the placements and do a lookup for those nodes.With this technique, we can calculate the distances between the placements for all three cases (promixal-promixal, proximal-distal and distal-proximal) cheaply. The wanted distance is then simply the minimum of those three distances. This is correct, because the two wrong cases will always produce an overestimation of the distance.This distance is normalized using the like_weight_ratio of both placements, before summing it up to calculate the total distance between the pqueries.The Matrix node_distances has to come from tree::node_branch_length_distance_matrix()."},

In many cases, it can be measured using the mean of the items. However, when considering placements on a tree, this does not truly measure how far they are from each other. Thus, this algorithm applies a different method of calculating the variance in terms of squared deviations of all items from each other: $ Var(X) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2 $, where $ (x_i - x_j) $ denotes the distance between two placements.According to the formula above, each pair of placements is evaluated twice, and subsequently their distance need to be halfed when being added to the sum of distanaces. Instead of that, we calculate the distance for each pair only once, thus are able skip half the calculations, and of course skip the division by two.Furthermore, the normalizing factor $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $ of the variance usually contains the number of elements being processed. However, as the placements are weighted by their like_weight_ratio, we instead calculate n as the sum of the like_weight_ratio of all placements. In case that for each pquery the ratios of all its placements sum up to 1.0, this number will be equal to the number of pqueries (and thus be equal to the usual case of using the number of elements).

The new leaf represents the most probable PqueryPlacement of the Pquery, measured using the like_weight_ratio. The leaf is positioned according to the proximal_length and pendant_length of the PqueryPlacement. The resulting Tree is useful to get an overview of the distribution of placements. It is mainly intended to view a few placements. For large Samples, it might be a bit cluttered.Similar trees are produced by RAxML EPA, where the file is called RAxML_labelledTree, and by the pplacer guppy `tog` command. Both programs differ in the exact way the the placements are added as edges. To control this behaviour, use the fully_resolve parameter.Parameter fully_resolve == falseIf fully_resolve is set to false (default), all placements at one edge are collected as children of one central base edge:\nThis method is similar to the way RAxML produces a labelled tree.The base edge is positioned on the original edge at the average proximal_length of the placements. The base edge has a multifurcation if there are more than two placements on the edge.The pendant_length of the placements is used to calculate the branch_length of the new placement edges. This calculation subtracts the shortest pendant_length of the placements on the edge, so that the base edge is maximally \"moved\" towards the placement edges. This also implies that at least one of the placement edges has branch_length == 0.0. Furthermore, the placements are sorted by their pendant_length.Using this method, the new nodes of the resulting tree are easier to distinguish and collapse, as all placements are collected under the base edge. However, this comes at the cost of losing the detailled information of the proximal_length of the placements. If you want to keep this information, use fully_resolve == true instead.Parameter fully_resolve == trueIf fully_resolve is set to true, the placements are turned into single leaf nodes:\nThis method is similar to the way guppy tog produces a labelled tree.The original edge is splitted into separate parts where each placement edge is attached. The branch_lengths between those parts are calculated using the proximal_length of the placements, while the branch_lengths of the placement edges use their pendant_length.Using this method gives maximum information, but results in a more crowded tree. The new placement edges are \"sorted\" along the original edge by their proximal_length. For this reason in the example image above, \"Query 2\" is closer to \"Node A\" then \"Query 1\": it has a higher proximal_length. This information was lost in the multifurcating tree from above.Further DetailsFor edges that contain only a single placement, both versions of fully_resolve behave the same. In this case, the placement is simply attached using its proximal_length and pendant_length.Pqueries with multiple PqueryNames are treated as if each name is a separate placement, i.e., for each of them, a new (identical) edge is added to the Tree.

It then calculates the earth mover's distance between those masses for the distrubitons induced by the two given Samples.In order to do so, first, a tree with the average branch lengths of the two PlacementTrees is calculated. This is because of numerical issues that might yield different branch lengths. This necessiates that the trees have the same topology. If not, an std::runtime_error is thrown. The masses are then distributed on this tree, using the same relative position on their branches that they had in their original trees.The calculation furthermore takes the multiplicities of the Pqueries into account. That means, pqueries with higher (total) multiplicity have a higher influence on the calculated distance.As the two Samples might have a different total number of Pqueries, the masses of the Samples are first normalized to 1.0, using all the like_weight_ratios and multiplicities of the Pqueries. As a consequence, the resulting distance will not reflect the total number of Pqueries, but only their relative (normalized) distrubution on the tree.Furthermore, the parameter p is used to control the influence of mass and distance, with 0.0 < p < inf, and default p == 1.0, which is the neutral case. A larger p increases the impact of distance traveled, while a smaller p emphasizes differences of mass.See earth_movers_distance( MassTree const&, MassTree const& ) for more information on the actual distance calculation and details on the parameter p."},

Thus, the transitive closure of shared names is collected.All those Pqueries with shared names are combined by simply moving all their Placements and Names into one Pquery and deleting the others. This means that at least the shared names will be doubled after this function. Also, Placements on the same edge can occur.
