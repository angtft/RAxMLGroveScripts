/**
 * @brief Main function that processes a jplace file and writes single jplace files for different
 * clades of the reference tree, each file containing the pqueries that fell into the clade with
 * more than a given threshold of accumulated likelihood weights.
 *
 * The program takes three input arguments in the following order:
 *
 *   1. A `jplace` input file. The pqueries in this file are then split into different samples. Each
 *      such sample contains all pqueries whose placements are placed in a certain clade of the
 *      reference tree with more than a cutoff threshold of their accumulated likelihood weight.
 *
 *      According to the `jplace` standard, each pquery can have multiple possible placement positions.
 *      Each position has a value `like_weight_ratio`, which can be interpreted as a measure of
 *      probability of how likely the placement belongs to the branch that it is attached to.
 *      The ratios for all branches of the tree thus sum up to 1.0.

 *      If more of this placement mass than the threshold is placed on the branches of a single
 *      clade of the tree, the according pquery is assigned to that clade. The threshold is
 *      hardcoded in this demo and set to 0.95 (but can be changed if needed, of course).
 *
 *      It is possible that the placement algorithm (e.g., EPA or pplacer) did not output placements
 *      with low like_weight_ratios, depending on the selected options (see the respective manual
 *      for more details on how to change this). This means that the provided sum might be lower
 *      than 1.0 for some pqueries. In order to compensate for this (thus, to avoid classifying
 *      those pqueries as uncertain), we normalize the like_weight_ratios first, so that their sum
 *      is 1.0 again. This step thus ignores the uncertainties resulting from the placement
 *      algorithm.
 *   2. A path to a file, which needs to contain a single line for each taxon of the reference tree.
 *      Each line needs to contain a tab-separated entry that maps from a taxon of the tree to the
 *      clade name that this taxon belongs to:
 *
 *          Taxon_1 <tab> clade_a
 *
 *      (where the " <tab> " of course is just a single tab character).
 *      The taxa names need to be the same as the node names of the reference tree in the `jplace`
 *      file.
 *
 *      If a taxon in a clade file is not found on the tree, a warning is issued, and the taxon is
 *      ignored. If the tree contains taxa which are not in any clade file, those branches are
 *      assigned to a special clade "basal_branches". This is also the case for the inner branches
 *      of the tree: all those branches which do not belong to one of the clades are collected in
 *      this special clade.
 *
 *      As a second special clade, the "uncertain" clade is used to collect all those pqueries
 *      which did not fall into any clade with more than the threshold of accumulated likelihood
 *      weights.
 *
 *      The edges that belong to a clade are determined by finding the smalles subtree (split) of
 *      the tree that contains all nodes of the clade. That means, the clades should be monophyletic
 *      in order for this algorithm to work properly. Furthermore, the user needs to make sure that
 *      each taxon is contained in at most one clade. Otherwise, the algorithm won't work properly.
 *
 *      Remark: The rooting of the tree is insignificant for this program. Even if the root
 *      coincidentally lies within one of the clades, the result is the same. The program does not
 *      change the root; thus, when visualizing the clades, be aware that the tree might look
 *      different depending on the rooting.
 *   3. An output directory path. For each clade (including the two special clades), a `jplace` file
 *      named after the clade is written to that path. Each `jplace` file then contains all pqueries
 *      that were assigned to that clade.
 *
 * A typical use case for this program is to extract pqueries that were placed in a particular
 * clade of interest in an evolutionary placement analysis. The extracted placements can then be
 * further examined in downstream analyses.
 *
 * It is also possible to do a second run of evolutionary placement with the original sequences of
 * the pqueries of one clade, using a refined reference tree for that clade with a higher resolution
 * (more reference taxa). This two-step placement approach allows for finely grained
 * placement positions while keeping the computational load relatively small.
