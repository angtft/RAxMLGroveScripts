/**
 * @brief Main function that processes jplace files and writes histograms for their LWRs and EDPLs.
 *
 * The program takes a path to either a `jplace` file, or a directory containing `jplace` files,
 * and builds histograms of the the placement mass (according to the
 * `like_weight_ratio`, LWR) of each placement and of the Expected Distance between Placement
 * Locations (EDPL).
 *
 * The program takes two arguments:
 *
 *     ./placement_histograms <path to jplace file(s)> <path to output directory>
 *
 * and writes the files `histogram_lwr.csv` and `histogram_edpl.csv` in `csv` format. Those files
 * can be opened with any spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc) and
 * visualized as e.g., histogram bar charts.
 *
 * The first analysis shows the distribution of the likelihood weights for the placements of the input
 * data. In other words, it shows how probable the placement with the highest likelihood weight is,
 * how probable the one with the second highest is, etc. In order to visualize this information for
 * all query sequences, it is summarized in form of histograms.
 *
 * ![Histogram of the first three most probable Likelihood Weight Ratios.](demos/hist_lwr.png)
 *
 * Those histograms can be interpreted as measures of quality of the placements:
 * The chart above shows the histogram of the first three most probable placement positions,
 * measured by their likelihood weight ratio (LWR).
 * The most probable placement location is visualized in blue, the second most
 * probable one in orange, the third one in green. The first LWR shows a peak at the `>= 0.8` bin,
 * meaning that many placements are placed with 80% certainty or more.
 *
 * There is also a second peak in the most probable placement position, around `0.45`, indicating
 * that there are quite some sequences that have a somewhat lower certainty.
 * This does not necessarily imply that the placement of the sequences in those bins is incorrect.
 * It can also indicate that there is more than one “good” candidate for placing it – for example,
 * if the corresponding sequence is from a species that does not have a very close relative in the
 * reference, but belongs to the same family as some species in the reference. In this case, one
 * expects to observe placements with a medium probability (likelihood weight) within different
 * branches of the subtree that entails the family.
 *
 * Thus, as a second analysis, the program assesses the locality of placements distributions for each
 * sequence over the tree. If they are all located in the same part of the reference tree, for
 * example at different branches of one family, this indicates that the sequence can be
 * confidently placed into that clade.
 *
 * The Expected Distance between Placement Locations (EDPL) is one way of quantifying this locality.
 * The EDPL calculates the weighted distance between all placement positions of a single
 * sequence. For weighting, the likelihood weights are used; the distance is measured along the
 * branches of the reference tree (i.e., the patristic distance between placements). Thus, the
 * EDPL quantifies to which extent the placements of a single sequence are scattered over the
 * tree. See http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_edpl.html for further details.
 *
 * ![Histogram of the Expected Distance between Placement Locations.](demos/hist_edpl.png)
 *
 * The second chart shows the distribution of EDPL values for our exemplary query sequences.
 * Most of the values are below `0.2`. This means that most sequences have a weighted distance that
 * is smaller than `0.2` between alternative placements (measured in branch length units).
 * Note that, the maximum likelihood reference tree used for the example has an average branch
 * length of `0.12`. Thus, the placement scatter (or radius) for almost all query sequences is smaller
 * than two branches, on average.
 *
 * Our example can be summarized like this: Many sequences have a placement probability of 80% or
 * higher. But even those with a lower probability for the most likely placement are spread over
 * nearby, local branches of the reference tree. Hence, the vast majority of placements shows high
 * confidence with respect to a single branch or a local neighborhood of branches.
