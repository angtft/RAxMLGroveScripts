Placement Histograms {#demos_placement_histograms}
===========

# Summary

Takes a path to either a `jplace` file, or a directory containing `jplace` files,
and builds histograms of the the placement mass (according to the
`like_weight_ratio`, LWR) of each placement and of the Expected Distance between Placement
Locations (EDPL).

This demo is located at

# Details

The program takes two arguments:

    ./placement_histograms <path to jplace file(s)> <path to output directory>

and writes the files `histogram_lwr.csv` and `histogram_edpl.csv` in `csv` format. Those files
can be opened with any spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc) and
visualized as e.g., histogram bar charts.

The first analysis shows the distribution of the likelihood weights for the placements of the input
data. In other words, it shows how probable the placement with the highest likelihood weight is,
how probable the one with the second highest is, etc. In order to visualize this information for
all query sequences, it is summarized in form of histograms.

Those histograms can be interpreted as measures of quality of the placements:
The chart above shows the histogram of the first three most probable placement positions,
measured by their likelihood weight ratio (LWR).
The most probable placement location is visualized in blue, the second most
probable one in orange, the third one in green. The first LWR shows a peak at the `>= 0.8` bin,
meaning that many placements are placed with 80% certainty or more.

There is also a second peak in the most probable placement position, around `0.45`, indicating
that there are quite some sequences that have a somewhat lower certainty.
This does not necessarily imply that the placement of the sequences in those bins is incorrect.
It can also indicate that there is more than one “good” candidate for placing it – for example,
if the corresponding sequence is from a species that does not have a very close relative in the
reference, but belongs to the same family as some species in the reference. In this case, one
expects to observe placements with a medium probability (likelihood weight) within different
branches of the subtree that entails the family.

Thus, as a second analysis, the program assesses the locality of placements distributions for each
sequence over the tree. If they are all located in the same part of the reference tree, for
example at different branches of one family, this indicates that the sequence can be
confidently placed into that clade.

The Expected Distance between Placement Locations (EDPL) is one way of quantifying this locality.
The EDPL calculates the weighted distance between all placement positions of a single
sequence. For weighting, the likelihood weights are used; the distance is measured along the
branches of the reference tree (i.e., the patristic distance between placements). Thus, the
EDPL quantifies to which extent the placements of a single sequence are scattered over the
tree. See http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_edpl.html for further details.

The second chart shows the distribution of EDPL values for our exemplary query sequences.
Most of the values are below `0.2`. This means that most sequences have a weighted distance that
is smaller than `0.2` between alternative placements (measured in branch length units).
Note that, the maximum likelihood reference tree used for the example has an average branch
length of `0.12`. Thus, the placement scatter (or radius) for almost all query sequences is smaller
than two branches, on average.

Our example can be summarized like this: Many sequences have a placement probability of 80% or
higher. But even those with a lower probability for the most likely placement are spread over
nearby, local branches of the reference tree. Hence, the vast majority of placements shows high
confidence with respect to a single branch or a local neighborhood of branches.
