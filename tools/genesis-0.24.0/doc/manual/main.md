The documentation of genesis has two main parts:
The **User Manual** and the **API Reference**.

**Important remark:** genesis is under active development and quite young. The manual is not yet
exhaustive, the API might change with subsequent releases, there might be functions missing that
you consider essential, and of course, there might be bugs.
Please [report all issues on our GitHub page](https://github.com/lczech/genesis/issues).
Your feedback is highly appreciated!

# User Manual

The manual contains high level explanations, tutorials and code examples for the
functionality of genesis. It is intended for end users who want to use existing scripts and
applications, and for getting started with genesis.

 <!-- *  @subpage intro -->
 *  @subpage setup
 *  @subpage tutorials
 *  @subpage demos

Furthermore, see the @subpage supplement for additional information.

# API Reference

The documentation of the application programming interface (API) is intended for users who want
to use genesis as a library or toolkit for their own applications.
It provides detailed references for the symbols defined in genesis:

 *  [Namespaces](namespaces.html)
 *  [Classes](annotated.html)
 *  [Source Files](files.html)

<!--
As the API Reference is generated from the doc-blocks in the C++ source code, it is mainly
oriented towards the C++ interface. It is however also suitable for the Python interface.
-->

# Support

For user support, please see our [Phylogenetic Placement Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phylogenetic-placement).
It is intended for discussions about phylogenetic placement,
and for user support for our software tools.
You can also find support for [EPA-ng](https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng)
and [Gappa](https://github.com/lczech/gappa) there.

For bug reports and feature requests, please
[open an issue on our GitHub page](https://github.com/lczech/genesis/issues).
